# This file is used to split insider and non insider configurations
INHERIT: mkdocs.yml

# Tag index page fails to display all pages when you have the meta plugin here.
# Because Meta is an insider only plugin, it has to be isolated in a specific config.
#
# uncomment the same lines in mkdocs.yml
# and the tag index pages will display all
# pages with tags even if the tags are set from the meta file
#
# note that the meta plugin is well taken into account when added here because, so no conf syntax issue, if you
# comment it here in addition to commenting it in mkdocs.yml, then pages don't have tags except
# third tag page that have them directly in the meta header. So it's working, but not completely.
